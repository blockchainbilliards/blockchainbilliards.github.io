### IN-GAME ECONOMY & REWARDS
Experience the best of both physical and virtual gameplay with our unique “phygital” rewards system. Here's how it works:

### Physical and Virtual Rewards
- Earn rewards in both physical league play and virtual gameplay.
- Physical rewards from league play are minted into NFTs. For example, win an 8 on the break patch in the league, and you'll receive a digital 8 on the break NFT in your linked wallet. 
- In the example below, we are illustrating the conceptual transformation of a league plaque for an 8 Ball Tournament Division Champion into the digital/NFT version.

### NFT Marketplace
- Access the NFT marketplace via our application.
- Link your wallet to list or manage your NFTs.

### Integrated NFTs
- NFTs are integrated into the Blockchain Billiards online game.
- Different NFTs have varied effects based on their rarity and difficulty to earn in league play.

### Earning and Using XP
- Gamers earn XP points by leveling up in the game.
- Exchange XP for NFTs that enhance gameplay, such as powerful cues or level boosts.
- NFTs earned through XP can also be resold in the marketplace.

### Blockchain Billiards Digital Currency
- Gamers can exchange their XP points for our digital currency (to be launched shortly).

### Play-to-Earn
- High-placed gamers on the leaderboard will receive airdrops of our digital currency and NFTs.
- Rewards are based on player standings and performance.
