### Timeline

FROM BETA TO FORMAL LEAGUE STATUS
We are currently in the Beta Phase. As we transition to Formal League status, we will be adding the following information:

Handbook: Detailed Game Rules and Sportsmanship Guidelines.

Handicap System: Comprehensive details on our handicap system.

League Operator Information: Guidance on how to become a League Operator.

Additionally, we may update our applications and technology to support these enhancements. For example, we will incorporate a scorekeeping component in our app once the handicap system is finalized.

We are currently at the __Break__ stage, where we are laying the foundation for our league. At this critical juncture, we are seeking __Founding Members__ to help create our league Handbook and guide us towards __Stage 2__.

We also invite __First-Generation League Players__ to join us in the formation stage, playing a crucial role in piloting and shaping our league's initial structure.

As we progress to __Stage 4__ and beyond, we will __begin accepting applications from League Operators__ to help expand and manage our growing league. Our goal is to reach Stage 5, where we become the largest billiards league in the world.

__Applications Open Now!__ Submit your interest and specify your role—Founding Member, First-Generation Player, or League Operator—to be added to our pool of applicants. We'll review your application and reach out when timelines open. [Click here to submit your interest.](https://www.blockchainbilliards.io/join-us)
