### Digital Collectibles 
Earn digital collectibles that represent achievements and milestones. These badges of honor are tied to your account and displayed within the community.

### Participation Points
We encourage continuous engagement, camaraderie, and practice. Earn points that convert into various NFTs for participating in matches and tournaments, not just for winning. 

### Valuable Gamified NFTs
League-play achievements are minted into NFTs, with rarity based on difficulty. Some NFTs range from rare to extremely rare. These valuable NFTs can be sold in the game's marketplace or held as digital collectibles. The following groups of members will have access to a range of rare to extremely rare NFTs for their roles in the creation, build-out, and continuous leadership, patronage, and support of the leagueâ€™s growth. 

### Founding Member NFTs
Awarded to the seven members shaping the league's founding rules and handbook.

### Pilot League NFTs
Given for early team registrations, referrals, and early league operator requests.

### Administrative NFTs
Awarded to individuals serving on committees, as league operators, team captains, and division leaders.

### Patron NFTs
Given to establishments hosting league play. Future plans may include featuring these establishments on an in-game tournament map, benefiting from in-game transactions.
