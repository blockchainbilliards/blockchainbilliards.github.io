Then, afterward, members will be able to select delegates according to standard procedures set forth in Section 6.02 of this Agreement.
   - The Handbook Committee will convene every two years (“biennially”) to ensure that immutable sections of the Handbook, this Agreement, and the Articles of Organization are not included in amendment proposals; and that amendment proposals do not materially impact the regulatory status of the League as a non-profit entity that would be in violation of the Wyoming Nonprofit Law.

### Section 6.02. Elections.

Members may cast votes on delegates for committees, amendments, issues/proposals, and treasury allocation decisions.

1. Each Member may cast a single vote per issue/proposal.
2. Members may vote on one member delegate per committee.
3. For issues/proposals, if a quorum is not met, a proposal is not passed. If a quorum is met, each proposal is brought forward to the DAO for a vote.
4. A quorum of 20% of the membership and a simple majority vote is required to propose and enact changes; except in an election to dissolve the League, which requires a quorum of 80% of the membership and an absolute majority vote.
5. Members will be able to make proposals during specific time periods through the DAO portal in the League’s Application.

6. All proposals are vetted by the Treasury and/or Handbook Committee(s) first before final proposals are sent back to the DAO for a final ratification vote.

7. The respective committee(s) will act collaboratively with members by receiving, reviewing, and introducing proposals back to members to vote on, except for the Executive Committee. Decisions made in the Executive Committee are the only decisions that are immutable and will not be made into proposals for voting.

8. Members’ delegates will be chosen based on committee membership size. Voting will be conducted via the DAO platform, where each member can select their top 5 or 7 choices corresponding to the committee's size. At the end of the voting period, delegates will be selected based on the highest votes received relative to the committee's membership size.

9. Delegates who relinquish their roles are replaced by the next delegate in the selection queue. This process continues for each relinquished role. If there is no additional delegate in the queue, an election will reopen until the roles are refilled for the allotted time of role tenure.

10. Delegates elected to serve on the Treasury and Executive Committees will have one-year terms, with elections held annually. Members of these committees are eligible for re-election, as there are no term limits. Members of the Handbook Committee, which convenes biennially to review proposals, are elected for one handbook review cycle and are also eligible for re-election without term limits.

### Section 6.03. Proposal And Voting Process.

1. **Proposal Submission Portal**. Members can submit proposals electronically via a dedicated section on the DAO platform. A templated format ensures that all necessary details are provided, facilitating a streamlined review process.

2. **Automated Review Mechanism**. Initial proposal screening is performed by smart contracts that check for compliance with submission criteria. Proposals meeting these criteria are automatically advanced for community discussion, committee review, and voting.

3. **Dynamic Voting System**. The DAO platform will feature a flexible voting system capable of supporting various mechanisms (e.g., one member, one vote; majority voting) to best suit the type of decision being made. This system adapts to the League's evolving governance needs, promoting equitable participation.

### Section 6.04. Membership Engagement And Transparency.

1. **Real-time Updates and Notifications**. Members will receive notifications through the DAO platform and other official communication channels about upcoming votes, proposal submissions, and results, ensuring high engagement and informed participation.

2. **Transparent Record-Keeping**. All decisions and proposal outcomes will be recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable history of the League’s governance actions. This level of transparency builds trust and accountability within the community.

### Section 6.05. Formal Amendment Review And Discussions.

1. **Designated Town Halls to discuss Amendment Proposals**. Biennially, when the Handbook Committee collects and reviews all member proposals for Amendments to the Handbook, or this Agreement, all proposals shall be discussed in recorded Town Halls that will be displayed on the League’s home page. Notifications for Town Halls will go out in advance to members through the Application, and/or will be posted on the webpage or on our verified social media channels, and members will be able to send their questions or comments through a form in the Application.

2. **Digital Announcement and Discussion Platform**. Detailed announcements of all approved, proposed amendments are made on the League’s website and shared across communication channels such as the Mobile Application and our verified social media channels.

## ARTICLE VII - DECENTRALIZED AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZATIONS (DAO)

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) typically operate on blockchain platforms and use tokens as a means of governance and participation. However, the exact requirements for participation in the League shall depend on individual membership with the League, and not proportionally through tokens. Each member will hold equal voting rights in the League.

### Section 7.01. DAO Democratic Governance.

At its core, the League is committed to a governance model that is inclusive and participatory. By leveraging blockchain technology, the league ensures that every member has a voice in the direction and decisions of the organization. This democratic approach allows for:

1. **Equal Voting Rights**. Utilizing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure to guarantee that each member’s vote carries equal weight, ensuring fairness in decision-making processes.

2. **Election of Delegate Representatives**. Members have the power to elect delegates to various committees.

3. **Proposal Initiatives**. Encouraging members to propose initiatives, changes, or improvements to the League’s rules or policies, promoting an environment of continuous innovation and adaptation.

### Section 7.02. Transparency In Decision-Making.

Transparency is a cornerstone of trust and accountability. By integrating blockchain technology, the League ensures that all decisions, financial transactions, and rule changes are recorded and easily accessible to all members, thereby allowing for:

1. **Immutable Records**. Leveraging the blockchain’s immutable ledger to maintain a transparent and unalterable record of decisions, votes, and transactions.

2. **Financial Transparency**. Displaying a clear view of the League’s financial status, including income from memberships, donations, and other activities, as well as expenditures, fostering trust and responsible financial stewardship.

3. **Open Communication**. Maintaining open channels of communication regarding governance decisions, league developments, and member contributions, ensuring that information is freely available and disseminated.

### Section 7.03. Active Community Engagement Among Members.

The League seeks to create a vibrant, engaged community of billiards enthusiasts united by a shared passion for the game and a belief in the potential of blockchain technology to enhance the sport. This involves:

1. **Member-Driven Initiatives**. Empowering members to lead and participate in initiatives that drive the global growth of billiards, from tournaments and competitions to educational programs and philanthropic activities.
