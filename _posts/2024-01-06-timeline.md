### Timeline

FROM BETA TO FORMAL LEAGUE STATUS
We are currently in the Beta Phase. As we transition to Formal League status, we will be adding the following information:

Handbook: Detailed Game Rules and Sportsmanship Guidelines.

Handicap System: Comprehensive details on our handicap system.

League Operator Information: Guidance on how to become a League Operator.

Additionally, we may update our applications and technology to support these enhancements. For example, we might incorporate a scorekeeping component in our app once the handicap system is finalized.
