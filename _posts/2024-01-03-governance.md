### League Governance
League members will have the opportunity to vote on crucial changes, including gameplay rules, sportsmanship guidelines, the handicap system, tournament formats, and the allocation of Treasury funds. Additionally, members will select member-delegates to manage all aspects of the League through various committees.

Our Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) operates like online polls but is reinforced by smart contracts that enforce our Operating Agreement and non-profit rules before any decisions are implemented. This ensures transparent, secure, and efficient governance, empowering our community to innovate and grow.
