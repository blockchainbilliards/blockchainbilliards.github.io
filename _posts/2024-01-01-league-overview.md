### We are redefining democratic engagement one billiards game at a time

Welcome to the Blockchain Billiards League! At the heart of our League is a commitment to giving everyone a voice. Governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and blockchain technology, our members have a say in everything—from game rules to rating and handicap systems, and even Treasury allocations. It's a place where your participation matters, whether you're racking up victories, showing up consistently, or demonstrating outstanding sportsmanship. Every effort is recognized and rewarded.

We understand that not everyone is familiar with DAOs, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), cryptocurrencies, or blockchain technology. That’s why we’re making it easy for newcomers to join, learn, and engage in a democratic process. This League isn't just a game; it's a proof-of-concept for how blockchain can democratize organizations, providing a new skill set and industry experience for all involved.

Join us in pioneering a new era in sports and governance. This isn't just any billiards league—it's the future. Welcome to a space where everyone has a stake in success and the opportunity to shape the future.
