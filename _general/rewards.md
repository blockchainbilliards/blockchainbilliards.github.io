### In-Game Economy & Rewards

At Blockchain Billiards, we’re transforming the link between physical and digital play with our innovative in-game rewards system. The Blockchain Billiards League operates as a DAO LLC and a Non-Profit, while the Game functions as a Corporation.  Our  League’s Operating Agreement (“Bylaws”) includes an Immutability Clause in Section 8, which ensures that no amendments can alter the agreements that allow members to trade or sell NFTs earned from League achievements in the Game’s NFT marketplace. We call this our “phygital” rewards system, seamlessly blending the physical and digital worlds.

Whether you are playing for the league or playing our game virtually, you will be able to receive rewards.

### How it works for League members:

#### Physical and Virtual Rewards

Earn rewards in physical league gameplay.
Physical rewards from league play are minted into NFTs. For example, win an 8 on the break patch in the league, and you’ll receive a digital 8 on the break NFT in your linked wallet.

#### NFT Marketplace

Access the NFT Marketplace via our application.
Link your wallet to list or manage your NFTs.

#### Integrated NFTS

NFTs are integrated into the Blockchain Billiards online game.
Different NFTs have varied effects based on their rarity and difficulty to earn in league play.
Game players will have the opportunity to purchase these NFTs, which will provide a range of utilities and enhancements within the game.

### How it works for Game players:

#### Earning and Using XP

Gamers earn XP points by leveling up in the game.
Exchange XP for NFTs that enhance gameplay, such as powerful cues or level boosts.
NFTs earned through XP can also be resold in the marketplace.
 
#### Blockchain Billiards Digital Currency

Gamers can exchange their XP points for our digital currency (to be launched in 2024-2025).
 
#### Play-to-Earn

This is a Web3 game, and the ability to offramp earnings is crucial to its success.
High-placed gamers on the leaderboard will receive airdrops of our digital currency and/or NFTs.
Rewards are based on player standings and performance.
